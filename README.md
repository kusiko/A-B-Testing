### Introduction

This is a Udacity lab with a focus on hypothesis testing. My goal was to work through the notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page for their website, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. 

I used multiple tools to analyze the dataset: from basic dataframe queries to building sampling distributions and logistic regressions.

I hope you enjoy reading the code as much as I did writing it. ;)
